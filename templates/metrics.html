                <h3>Synonyms</h3>
                <p>Words with similar meaning. Use synonyms to find the most precise word for your idea or avoid excessive repetition. Synonyms on Expresso are pulled from <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">WordNet corpus</a>. Up to ten synonyms of the same part of speech are displayed for each word.</p>
                <p>Examples: <i>to show</i> &#8212; <i>to point</i>, <i>to present</i>, <i>to indicate</i>, <i>to establish</i>.</p>

                <h3>Weak verbs</h3>
                <p>Most common English verbs with vague meaning (percent of all verbs). They don&rsquo;t trigger vivid imagery in readers&rsquo; heads and usually require additional words to deliver a meaningful message. Substituting weak verbs with more specific ones will liven most texts.</p>
                <p>Examples: <i>to be</i>, <i>to have</i>, <i>to do</i>, <i>to say</i>, <i>to go</i>, <i>to give</i>.</p>

                <h3>Filler words</h3>
                <p>Unnecessary words common in spoken language (percent of all words). They often don&rsquo;t add meaning and can be dropped.</p>
                <p>Examples: <i>very</i>, <i>much</i>, <i>just</i>, <i>actually</i>, <i>possibly</i>, <i>really</i>.</p>

                <h3>Nominalizations</h3>
                <p>Complex nouns extended from shorter verbs, adjectives and nouns (percent of all nouns and non-possessive pronouns). They often slow a reader down and may be hard to interpret. Expresso finds them by specific suffixes. Try to rearrange the sentence to use the original shorter and more lively version of the word.</p>
                <p>Examples: <i>practicality</i>, <i>tendency</i>, <i>indication</i>, <i>analysis</i>.</p>

                <h3>Entity substitutions</h3>
                <p>Pronouns and vague determiners common to spoken language (percent of all nouns and non-possessive pronouns). When overused, they can confuse a reader as the subject of the text would become more and more vague. If so, turn them into full entities with nouns, adjectives and adverbs.</p>
                <p>Examples: <i>it</i>, <i>this</i>, <i>him</i>, <i>there</i>, <i>thing</i>, <i>stuff</i>.</p>

                <h3>Negations</h3>
                <p>Words and prefixes which give attached words opposite meaning (number per sentence). When used too often, especially more than once in a sentence, they slow a reader down and can obscure meaning. If so, replace negations with positive expressions with similar meaning.</p>
                <p>Examples: <i>not</i>, <i>no</i>, <i>nothing</i>, <i>to undo</i>, <i>to misspell</i>.</p>

                <h3>Noun clusters</h3>
                <p>Three or more consecutive nouns with, possibly, “of” in between (percent of all nouns). Such clusters are often hard to comprehend. If so, mix them with strong verbs and adjectives.</p>
                <p>Examples: <i>automated motor starting circuit</i>, <i>penicillin skin test result group</i>.</p>

                <h3>Passive voice</h3>
                <p>Sentences and clauses where subject is the object of the main action (cases per sentence). Often, sentences in passive voice sound weak and can be confusing. If so, rephrase the sentence in active voice.</p>
                <p>Examples: <i>is made</i>, <i>is being carried</i>, <i>will be started</i>.</p>

                <h3>Modals</h3>
                <p>Verb modifiers signifying ability or necessity (percent of all verbs). They can weaken statements by making them uncertain or too radical. If so, consider dropping the modal or substituting it with a relevant adverb.</p>
                <p>Examples: <i>must</i>, <i>would</i>, <i>should</i>, <i>may</i>.</p>

                <h3>Rare words</h3>
                <p>Words outside of 5000 most frequently used English words (percent of all words). To find them Expresso uses <a href="http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/" target="_blank">Corpus of Contemporary American English</a>. Your readers might not know some rare words which can drop text comprehension. If so, substitute rare words with more common synonyms.</p>
                <p>Examples: <i>to glare</i>, <i>to extort</i>, <i>an embassy</i>, <i>a bottleneck</i>, <i>pragmatism</i>.</p>

                <h3>Extra long sentences</h3>
                <p>Sentences with 40 or more words (percent of all sentences). They might be too hard to understand. If so, break them down into several smaller sentences.</p>
                <p>Example: <i>“If, then, I were asked for the most important advice I could give, that which I considered to be the most useful to the men of our century, I should simply say: in the name of God, stop a moment, cease your work, look around you.”</i> &mdash; Leo Tolstoy, Essays, Letters and Miscellanies</p>

                <h3>Extra short sentences</h3>
                <p>Sentences with 6 or fewer words (percent of all sentences). They might be too boring. If so, expand them by adding more detail.</p>
                <p>Example: <i>The day is warm.</i></p>

                <h3>Frequent words</h3>
                <p>Most frequent words in text excluding <a href="/metrics#stopwords">stopwords</a> described below (number of occurrences). When clustered they can sound too repetitive. If so, replace some of them with synonyms.</p>

                <h3>Frequent bigrams</h3>
                <p>Most frequent pairs of words in text excluding <a href="/metrics#stopwords">stopwords</a> described below (number of occurrences). When clustered they can sound too repetitive. If so, replace some of them with synonymous phrases.</p>

                <h3>Frequent trigrams</h3>
                <p>Most frequent triplets of words in text (number of occurrences). When clustered they can sound too repetitive. If so, replace some of them with synonymous phrases.</p>

                <h3>Vocabulary size</h3>
                <p>Number of different word stems in text. Expresso finds stems of words via <a href="http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn-/trunk/doc/howto/tokenize.html" target="_blank">NLTK Porter word tokenizer</a>.</p>

                <h3>Sentences</h3>
                <p>Number of sentences in text. This metric highlights the first word in each sentence to easily see the pattern of sentence lengths.</p>

                <h3>Syllables per word</h3>
                <p>Average number of syllables per word in text. Expresso breaks words into syllables using <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary</a>.</p>

                <h3>Readability grade</h3>
                <p>Comprehension level roughly corresponding to an American school grade. Expresso computes it using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_Readability_Test" target="_blank">Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level formula</a>. The grade is given only to texts with 100 or more words.</p>

                <h3>Parts of speech</h3>
                <p>Words of a particular part of speech in text (percent of all words). Expresso puts all words into one of six categories: nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and other parts of speech. This categorization is done via default <a href="http://nltk.org/book/ch05.html" target="_blank">NLTK part-of-speech tagger</a>.</p>

                <h3 id="stopwords">Stopwords</h3>
                <p>Most common words not carrying text-specific information (percent of all words). Expresso finds them using <a href="http://nltk.org/nltk_data/" target="_blank">NLTK Stopwords Corpus</a>.</p>
                <p>Examples: <i>it</i>, <i>this</i>, <i>the</i>, <i>up</i>, <i>will</i>.</p>
